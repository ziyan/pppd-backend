pppd-backend
============

Executes a program to check username/password pair for pppd.

Usage
=====

Create a symlink or copy backend.so to /usr/lib/pppd/VERSION/

In /etc/ppp/pptp-options and /etc/ppp/options.xl2tp, add:

    debug
    plugin backend.so
    backend_command "/etc/ppp/auth.sh %s"

Replace the command with what you want to execute.
Remember to include %s for the username.
Your executable should output with the secret associated with the user in one line if the user is valid.

Example auth.sh would be:

    #!/bin/sh
    USER=$1
    [ "$USER" == "test" ] && echo "password"
